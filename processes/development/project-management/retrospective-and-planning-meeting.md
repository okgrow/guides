For each project the project advisor runs a weekly retrospective and planning meeting as early as possible on Monday. This is usually for the develoment team only, we have a separate client meeting any time in the week.

1. Retrospective
    1. In the "retrospective notes" docment for the project list what we’re happy/sad/neutral about with a to-do item to fix each “sad” item if possible
    1. Update iteration tracking spreadsheet (“burn-up chart”)
1. Planning
    1. Create a new list named “Done YYYY-MM-DD” for the current iteration using today's date (which should be Monday).
    1. Plan at least the next week’s worth of stories by adding a “Tasks” checklist to each one and listing all the technical tasks in as much detail as possible.
        1. When a group of work is estimated together to be done as a specific phase or sprint then add a green tag to each card so that changes and additions become obvious.
    1. Update the card’s title with the number of “ideal days”. We use the [Scrum for Trello Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrum-for-trello/jdbcdblgjdpmfninkoogcfpnkjmndgje?hl=en) to add the estimate to the card (the plugin talks about “points” but for us they’re ideal days).
    1. Move the week’s worth of stories into the “This week” column.
    1. Make sure the client is moving things to “Done”
